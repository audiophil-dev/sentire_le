# Documentation for the Sentire "lite" Software (sentire-le)

## Sentire

Sentire [sen'ti:re] is an [art project](sentire.me), a research project and furthermore, the name of a digital system that mediates between bodily movements and musical sounds. 

The technology can sense inter-body proximity and touch.

These physical parameters are mapped to an algorithmic _sound environment_ in real time, allowing for a _closed-loop auditory interaction_ between two or more people in a physical environment.

This site documents the installation and usage of the sentire "lite" software, a public version of the sentire software.

The intention is to make a basic version of sentire accessible to a broader public. With the software, an audio interface and two (modified) audio cables (see section Setting up sentire), you can try the interactive system. 

Even without using the hardware, the [software](/docs/index#sentire-software) (written in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/)) can be a good starting point for working with algorithmic sound environments mapped to one-dimensional parameter spaces.
